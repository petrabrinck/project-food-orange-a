# A Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

The purpose was to practice my JavaScript and API skills a bit more. I also got to practice using GitHub as a team. I experienced, first-hand, the issues and struggles that can occur when working together with code. 

Main focus was to build a website that lists restaurants, reviews and information based on location. 

It is built based on a random combination of cuisine, city, and design provided. All data should be fetched from the [Zomato API.](https://developers.zomato.com/)  

## my combination: Peruvian food in New York City, NY
and to use this:![Deliveroo](https://i.imgur.com/GHFJy1k.png)

### Step 1

Each member of my team cloned a (NOT FORK!) the correct repo for my team.

### Step 2

Togeteher as a mob, do the foundations of the project together. Make sure that you have fetched from the API and presented all data on the page in a suitable HTML structure which you all agree on. No styling is needed at this point. 

Requirements: 
You should have data from at least 10 restaurants from the `/search` endpoint on your page, and include the following data: 

* The restaurant name
* The average cost for a dinner there
* The address of the restaurant
* An image (you choose which image you'd like to display from the response)
* Either the `aggregate_rating` or the `rating_text` for that restaurant
  
  Add so that your users can filter restaurants based on different price ranges. 
  Add so that your users can sort the resturants on price, cheap to expensive using the `average_cost_for_two` parameter. 
  List the 3 latest reviews for each restaurant. 
  Filter on delivery options
  Make it so your users can choose to only show restaurants with good ratings.
